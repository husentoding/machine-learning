how to use:

package needed: pandas, matplotlib



-Training model
use kmeans_learning_model.py to generate centroids
code explanation can be found on this file

-Testing model to data test
use kmeans_result.py to generate the cluster based on predefined centroids(i got this from observation from training)
the results of clustering can be found on file "results_here.txt"

most of the code on kmeans_result.py are the same with training model
