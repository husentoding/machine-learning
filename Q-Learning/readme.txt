By default, the program will print R matrix, the agent's position in your terminal and the total reward to reach the final/goal state
You may see the agent's memory/Q matrix on file results.txt
You also may print the result on your terminal by removing the comment tag on line 173 ( function printQ(q) )

Please be aware that the program will read file DataTugasML3.txt on run time. Make sure you put main.py and DataTugasML3.txt on the same folder.
